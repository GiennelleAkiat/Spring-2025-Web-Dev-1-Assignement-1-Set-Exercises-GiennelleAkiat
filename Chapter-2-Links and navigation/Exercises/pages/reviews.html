            <p>A lot of people say this game is just completely ripping off the souls games but I think it has enough uniqueness to distinguish itself from other soulslikes. The undodgeable, unblockable red attacks are an interesting mechanic that is really rewarding when done successfully and really punishing when messed up. The vinyl records you can get are just amazing as well, just gorgeous music. The implementation of puppet parts that function as your armor is also a nice touch because this allows you freedom in what outfits you can wear making it so you don't have to sacrifice fashion for defense. I also saw another reviewer mention how the enemies have clearly choreographed attacks because they are puppets which is true to some degree, but you'll find that puppets aren't the only enemies in the game and on top of that a lot of puppets will sometimes short circuit in between some attacks messing up their easily readable attacks which was honestly a nice touch. If you enjoy soulslike games I would highly recommend this one, as it is probably the best soulslike I have ever played besides the soulsborne games.</p>

            <p>Going into this game, I didn't know what to expect. But I am very much glad I played through this incredible game. There were so many things that caught my attention. The story was more straight forward than other soulz like games, the characters were fun and had alot of meaning to them and by far the gameplay made this game absolutely worth it. Sure it is a very difficult game based on the fact it is soulz like but in general the gameplay was incredible. The way you are able to parry so well gives that satisfying feel to the combat and the moves you create pulls you in quickly when fighting enemies. The bosses were also alot of fun to fight. Usually in games there are some that are mid but each one I had a genuinely fun time battling. If you want to play a game that has a nice story, great combat and is abit of a challenge, this is definitely the game for you.</p>

            <p>Incredible game, with an outstanding story, gameplay, and graphics. 10 out of 10. <br>First, I am not a heavy gamer, but Lies of P shocked me, in a good way, because of how good it is. Outstanding story, gameplay, and graphics had me hooked. The game seemed difficult in the beginning, and you end up “dying a lot “but once you learn how to play the game, you are on a roll. Please ignore those negative comments, as they are coming from players who were not patient enough to get practice and gain an understanding of the details. This game is now on my list of favourite top 10 PC games of all time (which also includes The Witcher, Jedi Survivor, God of War, GTA 5, Skyrim…… which says a lot about the game). Lies of P is one of those games that gets better the more you play it, and then you get so surprised when you start a new level. Because you find yourself discovering even deeper secrets and puzzles. The game is so vast with so many hidden ways to discover. This is the only game that I decided to play Plus (+) level 😊, and I was not disappointed in what it had to offer. I am still playing it, and I hope they make Lies of P 2.</p>
